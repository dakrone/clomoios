# Clomoios

"Context searching using NLP magic"

Clomoios comes from combining 'Clojure' and 'Omoios', which means "similar" in
Greek. Finding similar things is what Clomoios aims to help you do.

Loosely based on this blog post: [Context searching using Clojure-OpenNLP](http://writequit.org/blog/?p=351)

## Usage

At the moment, see the tests in the test directory and the
comments at the bottom of `src/clomoios/contextsearcher.clj` and
`src/clomoios/seededcontextsearcher.clj`

More to follow

## Installation

    lein deps
    lein test
    lein jar

Should work.

## License

Still considering what license to use.
